# Changelog

All notable changes to the MeinTurnierplan WordPress plugin will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-30

### Changed
- **Internationalization Improvements**: Made all JavaScript notification messages translatable
- Wrapped all admin utility JavaScript strings with WordPress translation functions (`__()` and `esc_js()`)
- Messages now properly support multi-language translations through `.po` and `.mo` files

### Technical Details
- Updated `class-mtp-admin-utilities.php` JavaScript output to use PHP translation functions
- Affected messages:
  - "No participants found for this tournament."
  - "Error refreshing participants. Please try again."
  - "No groups found for this tournament."
  - "Error refreshing groups. Please try again."
  - "Groups refreshed successfully!"
  - "Participants refreshed successfully!"
- All notification strings are now consistent with plugin's translation system
- Improves user experience for non-English speakers

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-16
- Initial production ready release

## [0.3.2] - 2025-10-16

### Added
- **Requirements Checker**: New `MTP_Requirements_Checker` class that validates minimum system requirements before plugin initialization
- Minimum requirements: PHP 7.4+ and WordPress 6.3+ (required for Block API version 3)
- User-friendly admin notices when requirements are not met
- **Uninstall Hook**: Proper `uninstall.php` file for clean plugin removal
- Complete data cleanup on uninstall (custom post types, post meta, options, transients)

### Changed
- Moved requirements validation from inline function to dedicated class
- Improved main plugin file organization and readability
- Updated plugin version to 0.3.2
- Enhanced code documentation with proper @since tags

### Technical Details
- New file: `includes/class-mtp-requirements-checker.php`
- New file: `uninstall.php` (connects to existing `MTP_Installer::uninstall()` method)
- Requirements are defined as class constants for easy maintenance
- Requirements check happens early in plugin loading process
- If requirements fail, plugin stops initialization gracefully
- Uninstall process removes: all custom post types, post meta with `_mtp_` prefix, plugin options, and transients

### Security & Best Practices
- Follows WordPress plugin development best practices
- Proper security checks in uninstall.php (`WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN` constant)
- Clean separation of concerns with dedicated checker class
- Ready for WordPress.org plugin directory submission

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-16

### Added
- **Auto-populate Single CPT Pages**: New `MTP_Single_Content_Filter` class that automatically displays tournament tables and match lists on their single post pages
- Content filter hooks into WordPress's `the_content` filter
- Automatically retrieves all saved settings and renders appropriate content
- Works for both `mtp_table` and `mtp_match_list` custom post types

### Changed
- Updated plugin version to 0.3.1
- Enhanced README with documentation about automatic content display
- Updated file structure documentation

### Fixed
- Corrected meta key mappings from shortcode attributes to actual database field names (e.g., `_mtp_tournament_id` instead of `_mtp_external_id`)
- Fixed all styling and display option meta key references to match actual field names saved in database
- Added proper color-with-opacity conversion helper method for background colors

### Technical Details
- New file: `includes/class-mtp-single-content-filter.php`
- Uses `is_singular()`, `in_the_loop()`, and `is_main_query()` checks to ensure proper execution
- Retrieves external ID and all style/display settings from post meta
- Passes settings to appropriate renderer (table or matches)

### How It Works
When a user visits a single tournament table or match list page (e.g., `/tournament-table/my-tournament/`):

1. The content filter checks if we're on a single CPT page
2. Retrieves the external ID from post meta (`_mtp_external_id`)
3. Gathers all saved shortcode attributes from post meta
4. Calls the appropriate renderer with these settings
5. Prepends the rendered content to any existing post content

No manual shortcode insertion needed on single CPT pages!
